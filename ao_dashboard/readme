# Anarchy Online External Tracker

🧠 **Overview**

This project provides a real-time external dashboard for *Anarchy Online* players.  
It parses live log files (Chat.log and System.log), tracks XP, credits, loot, chat history, zone changes, critical hits, and network latency — without interfering with the game window.

Built using:
- 🟦 **Go backend** for high-performance log parsing, ping monitoring, and state management
- 🟧 **Python (PyQt6) frontend** for a dark-themed second-monitor dashboard

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Requirements

#### Backend (Go)
- Install Go 1.21+ from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/)
- Verify install: `go version`

#### Frontend (Python)
- Install Python 3.10+ from [https://python.org/](https://python.org/)
- Install required libraries:

```bash
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Configuration

Optional: Edit backend/config.json to adjust:

    chat_log_path: Path to your AO Chat.log

    system_log_path: Path to your AO System.log

    state_file_path: Where shared JSON is stored (default ../shared/state.json)

    ping_address: Address to ping for latency checking (default 8.8.8.8)

    ping_interval_ms: How often to ping (in milliseconds)

If config.json is missing, default paths are used.
3. Running the Project

You can manually start each:
Backend:

cd backend
go run main.go

Frontend:

cd frontend
python3 main.py

Or use the provided launcher:

bash run.sh

🎨 Features
Feature	Details

🛠️ Future Roadmap

    Real XP bar based on level-specific XP

    XP/hour tracking and session graphs

    Sound alerts for high-value loot or big crits

    Loot value calculator

    Auto-summary of session stats

🧪 Developer Notes

    Backend auto-saves state.json every 1 second.

    Frontend auto-refreshes view every 500 milliseconds.

    If backend or frontend crash, they can be restarted separately — no dependency.

📜 License

TBD — Recommend MIT License for maximum flexibility.
